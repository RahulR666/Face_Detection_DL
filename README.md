# Face_Detection_DL

This project involves developing a comprehensive image augmentation and object detection pipeline using TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Albumentations. The project includes data collection, augmentation, model training using a deep learning architecture, and real-time object detection.

## Features

- **Image Collection**: Capture images using OpenCV and annotate them with LabelMe.
- **Image Augmentation**: Enhance the dataset with various transformations using Albumentations to improve model robustness.
- **Deep Learning Model**: Implement a custom deep learning model using TensorFlowâ€™s Functional API and VGG16 for object detection and localization.
- **Real-Time Prediction**: Deploy the trained model for real-time object detection using a webcam feed.

## Tools, Frameworks, and Libraries

### Programming Language
- **Python**: The primary language used for the entire project.

### Libraries and Frameworks
- **TensorFlow**: Used for building and training the deep learning model.
- **OpenCV**: Utilized for image capture, processing, and real-time video feed.
- **Albumentations**: Employed for applying advanced image augmentation techniques.
- **LabelMe**: Used for annotating images with bounding boxes.

### Tools
- **Webcam**: Used to capture real-time video input for prediction.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    https://github.com/RahulR666/Face_Detection_DL.git
    cd object-detection-augmentation
    ```

2. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**:
    - Open the `object_detection_augmentation.ipynb` file and follow the steps to collect images, augment data, train the model, and perform real-time detection.

## How It Works

- The project begins with collecting images via a webcam and annotating them using LabelMe.
- Augmentation techniques like cropping, flipping, brightness adjustment, and more are applied to the images and annotations.
- A deep learning model based on VGG16 architecture is trained for object detection, using custom loss functions to optimize performance.
- Finally, the model is deployed to perform real-time detection and localization using a webcam feed.

## Future Enhancements

- Expand the augmentation pipeline with more transformations.
- Improve model accuracy by experimenting with different architectures and hyperparameters.
- Integrate more complex real-time detection scenarios with multiple objects.
